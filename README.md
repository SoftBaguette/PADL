# What is PADL

PADL stands for Probabilistic and Deep Learning. It is a course taken at the University of York.

## Module aims

This module advances the IS stream by introducing the basics of machine learning, purely from an optimisation perspective. The range of topics covers linear regression (picking up where Data left off) to decision trees, simple neural networks, and advanced machine learning. Understanding ML requires knowledge of some mathematical concepts that build upon A-level standard mathematics, specifically: Linear Algebra and Continuous Optimisation. This will be taught in-place. Students will see motivating real world problems, the ML techniques required to solve them, the underlying mathematics needed for the technique and their practical implementation. Practicals will be taught using a python-based modern machine learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch and so students will gain experience with the declarative programming paradigm (building on the Software stream).

## Module learning outcomes
- Explain the probabilistic basis of machine learning

- Demonstrate a working knowledge of manifold embedding and kernel methods

- Apply a range of Bayesian methods for classification and clustering

- Be familiar with the main deep learning architectures

- Demonstrate the optimisation process and different variants (i.e. gradient descent, stochastic algorithms, ADAM)
